# cinema

File management system for my movies

# Description

This is a database management application for films and tv shows.

# Technologies Used:

NodeJS + SQLite3

# Installation Instructions:

First, clone this repo to a directory on your local machine and run npm install:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jmz527/cinema.git
cd cinema/
npm i
```

# SQLite3 Database Setup

Next up, we have the database setup. I've used SQLite3 here.

To create the sqlite3 database file you must create and seed the database using node & the custom "seed.js" file in the root directory:

```sh
node seed.js
```

This may take a minute

With the database populated, you can now start up the sqlite api with express:

```sh
node index.js
```
